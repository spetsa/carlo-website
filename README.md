Hola!

I’ve been helping startups grow their revenue and user base for the past 6 years. Working in enterprise sales, growth, and product — I’ve developed a robust idea of how to develop a product users love, a funnel that converts them, and an experience that retains them.

**At the moment I’m looking for a Growth Product Management role — if you're interested in learning more or know anyone that might be, shoot me an email at spencer.badanai@gmail.com.**

**Intro to GrowthLander**
I have built, helped build, and overseen the development of landing pages for Pre Seed to Series B startups. I have found a structure that I have seen work time and time again — that is what this template is based off of. Keep in mind your conversion rates are only as good as the leads you send there. I hope to help founders tackle that problem next.  

The way it works is simple, open the HTML/CSS files and replace the written prompts with your copy. For additional tips watch the Youtube videos which will take you through the template and better describe how to think about writing your copy.

**File hierarchy and navigation**
Inside the LanderGrowth-Template
The HTML Files
The “CSS” folder which includes all CSS and stylings
The “Logos” folder where you can store your logos
The “banner_images” file where you can see banner images that have been converted to WebP. All of which are free to use from Unsplash. 
The “webp conversions” folder which contains a number of handpicked Unsplash images that have all been converted to Webp.

**Photos**
Try to use as many photos of casual + normal people as possible on your site. In my experience these lead to the most conversions. The more produced the less likely people are to believe what you are selling. Of course, you should also include some screenshots of your product if you have them.

**Updates to Come**
In the coming weeks I will be adding additional code that will make integration with Google Analytics & Google Optimize much easier. I will also create videos describing how to get the most out of these Softwares + Inspectlet. 

Once this update is complete I hope to start working on templates for outbound email and cold calling strategies. I have achieved open rates as high as 75% and conversions as high as 15% and I would like to share how I accomplished that. 

When you get your first conversion on the template please let me know!

Happy startupping,
Spencer
